# Food Ordering Application 

An online food ordering system accepts orders from customers and delivers at customerâ€™s
address. Items are selected from a menu and the total bill amount is calculated. Selected items
may be put in a cart and addition, deletion of items in the cart is possible. Once the order is
confirmed, the time taken for delivery is intimated and the order can be tracked. There are
several payment modes, cash/wallet/bank transfer/credit/debit card on delivery or pre-paid.
Orders placed may be cancelled if delivery time exceeds 10% of specified time.

The following features of the Application

1. Authentication
